Lab 6 Reflection
Inheritance is when you define a class that inherits the methods from a previous class. This helps to build more complex code. In this code, The hero and enemy inherit the methods of character.
	
Association is when two classes are related from their objects and methods. Enemy and Hero are associated as they both inherit the attributes and methods of a character and operate similarly. Also, they associate with the weapon class as they both use weapons

Encapsulation restricts access to the public of certain components of the object and its data. A single underscore makes the code protected and a double underscore makes the code private. For this project, encapsulation is used to initiate the methods.
